## 👋 Welcome!

Welcome to my **Data Analysis Dashboards** repository! I’m passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights using tools like **Power BI, Excel, SQL, and Python**.

With an academic background in **Finance (MBA)** and experience in **HR, Accounting, Social Media, and Program Coordination**, I combine business understanding with analytical skills to build dashboards that tell data stories clearly and effectively.
